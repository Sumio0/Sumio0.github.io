I’m **Fan Yi**, a Computer Science undergraduate at **Columbia University**, passionate about the intersection of user-centric design and computational efficiency.

My academic path includes projects in software engineering and AI, with a strong emphasis on **full-stack development, data structures, and product thinking**. Previously, I worked at **Tencent** and **Alibaba**, where I applied technical and strategic skills to real-world product and operations challenges.

I’m constantly exploring how code can shape user behavior, streamline systems, and bridge global audiences—whether through intelligent course recommendation systems, e-commerce logistics optimization, or fast text-processing engines.

In my free time, I enjoy working on independent ventures, learning new frameworks, and writing about how design and algorithms impact everyday interactions.

Feel free to connect or collaborate!
